# FlashCards

## Learning Goals

- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

The project spec & rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html)

## Overview

Do you love trying to play a game that doesn't work?? Perfect! This game is for you! For an unknown reason to the developer, there is a bug that's preventing this game's general capabilities. There is a test suite for each class file with passing tests for each method.
